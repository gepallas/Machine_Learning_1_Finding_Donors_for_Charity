    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "- A real world application that logistic regression can be applied is a reseller of magazines that wants to identify whether an individual will buy or not a magazine, based on characteristics like income, gender, education, marital status etc. In this problem, the reseller might be interested in identifying to which individuals to send advertisments, e.g. via email, or to identify which magazines to recommend to a customer that is viewing specific items in a webpage. This is a dataset with similar characteristics to the Finding_Donors dataset. Another case study that logistic regression has been used is to study the customer loyalty in an online store. The dataset consisted of variables like gender, age, place of residence and order value.\n",
    "- The strength of the model is that it is a simple and fast model that performs well when the data are linearly separated. It is a simple model similar linear regression, in the sense that, just like linear regression, coefficients are the key representation of logistic regression. Logistic regression uses probabilites in order to make predictions and classify a data point. If these probabilities are above a threshold then the data points are classified as 1, if they are below that threshold they are classified as 0.\n",
    "- The model performs poorly when the data are not linearly separated. Furthermore, Logistic Rergression is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- Since the goal of this project is to classify individuals as potential donors or not, the logistic regression algorithm is a classification algolirthm that can be used for that purpose. The characteristics of the dataset are similar to the ones I described above. Logistic regression can be a good base model.\n",

    "#### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "- A real world application of the support vector machine algorithm is to forecast the daily global solar radiation using metereological data such as temperature, precipitation and extra-terrestrial solar radiation.\n",
    "- Support vector machines (SVMs) can be used for classification and regression problems and can be applied to both linear and non-linear problems. SVMs can work well with datasets with a large number of features. They also work well when sparcity of data is high. A non-linear SVM can capture more complex relationships among the data points.\n",
    "- The disadvantage of SVM is that it is computentionally intensive and thus training time might take longer than other algorithms (also depending on the dataset and number of features and samples). Another drawback is that data should be in feature-vector format for the SVM to be applied, which is not always the case. SVMs have been popular in the past, but with recent developments they are usually outperfomed by more popular deep neural networks and gradient boosting methods.\n",
    "- In our dataset we have a small/medium number of features and about 45,000 data points. Since the number of features and samples is not that large SVMs should be computentionally ok with the training. Furthermore, if the relationship between the features and the target variable is non-linear SVM might be able to accurately capture that relationhip. It would be also very interesting to see how a non-linear SVM performs compared to the logistic regression model.\n",

    "#### Ensemble methods: AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "- A real world application of AdaBoost (or Adaptive Boosting) is to predict the customer churn (for the case of a commercial bank in China). Customer churn is when a subscriber/user of a service/product stops doing business with the company. The algorithm uses customer demographic characteristics (e.g. education level, number of children etc) as well as other behavioural and company interaction variables to make predictions regarding the customer churn.\n",
    "- Adaboost is a powerful classification (as well as regression) ML algorithm that combines weak learners (such us decision trees) to produce a strong learner to reduce the risk of overfitting. Adaboost is a fast and easy to program algorithm. The only parameter to tune in Adaboost is the number of rounds in which the boosting is terminated.\n",
    "- A drawback is that Adaboost is affected by noisy data. In addition, outliers can affect significantly the performance of the algorithm (since it will work hard to correct any unrealistic cases).\n",
    "- AdaBoost (and ensemble methods) is a powerful classifier to be used in various cases. Our dataset is sufficiently big and data are clean and AdaBoost should be a good choice for this case.\n",
